These are all the command run to setup a new computer to run simulations.
Included are basic things like setting up openssh and editors which can be skipped if you wish

Install Ubuntu 24.04 on a new computer or VM.

Install Matlab on the computer
    I recommend installing to local user - makes python engine easier to install

Download wxpython from https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ubuntu-24.04/

Then from home folder of user with sudo privileges:

Basic stuff
> sudo apt install openssh-server git python3-venv python3-dev vim-gtk3 build-essential libcairo2 libcairo2-dev libsdl2-dev tree ack
> ssh-keygen 

GUI Software
> git clone https://github.com/bl-software/sim_rbco2.git
> cd sim_rbco2-main/
> python3 -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate

>  gvim reqs.txt 
Comment out wxpython and matlabengine
>  pip install -r reqs.txt 
>  pip install ~/Downloads/wxpython-4.2.3-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl 


ONE OF THESE SHOULD INSTALL MATLAB PYTHON ENGINE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU INSTALLED MATLAB
This has changed over the years, very finicky
>  cd /usr/local/MATLAB/R2024b/extern/engines/python/
>  pip install .
>  pip install --user .
>  sudo /home/dhuffman/sim_rbco2-main/venv/bin/python -m pip install .

Run it watch for errros in installation
>  PYOPENGL_PLATFORM=egl python mgui.py --simtype=2
