Trying to get modern Stack397 version working.

Oddness calling VERSION/GL_2_9

and Context error.

EGL made it work

after addig IsSHownOnScreen stuff`


PYOPENGL_PLATFORM=egl python stack39734211.py
Now try test3.py and test4X.py
Must get BaseWX to work
comparet the two

UNDO MOST OF LAST COMMIT _ LOTS OF TESTING STUFF

test3 works - now working thru other uses of pygame like right now "input"

test46 comes up - working on  getting movementrig and inputWX working
